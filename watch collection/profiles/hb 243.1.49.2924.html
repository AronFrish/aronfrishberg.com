                    <h2 id="desc">Story : To repair this, I had to get a new battery, as well as a new stem and crown.  This was my first time ordering and installing a stem, so it was a big accomplishment for me and big step in my hobby of watch making.  I really enjoy wearing it as it has a unique clasp in the back, is a cool black metal look, and is very comfortable and cool looking.</h2>
