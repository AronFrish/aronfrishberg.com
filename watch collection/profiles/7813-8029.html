                    <h2 id="desc">Story : This was one of my first watches that I bought to repair and it has been quite problematic.  When I first bought it, I couldn't get it open, so I had to bring it to a jewellery store (who failed) and then finally to a watch maker.  After that, I replaced the battery, repaired the glass and bought a brand new leather band.  This was my first successful glass repair, so it was a proud accomplishment for me.  A few days after replacing the glass however, it started randomly going backwards in time.  I fixed this by installing a better new battery and it works perfectly.  It is currently my favorite watch in my collection because I love how it looks and because of the work that went into it.</h2>
