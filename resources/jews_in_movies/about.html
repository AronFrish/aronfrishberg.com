	<h3 style="width:calc(70vw);">For this project, I created a Python program that takes a list of wikipedia links of movies, and looks through the source code of 
	each page for the first 200 links.  It then goes through all the links found and checks if the page belongs to a person of Jewish descent.  After this, it stores all of the data and 
	I created another program to create webpages for each entry.  It indexed over 1000 movies as of 6/18/22.</h3>
	<h3 style="width:calc(70vw);">I do not have any malicious intentions with this information, I am just interested in Jewish culture and thought this would be an interesting and challenging puzzle.</h3>
