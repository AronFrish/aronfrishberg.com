			Many experts believe that by 2100, as much as 23% of New York City will be under the sea level, with much more of the city becoming victim to extreme costal flooding.  
			This is nothing short of a crisis.  In wake of this new research, I've decided to collaborate with David Zoota, a New York based photographer, to spread the word.  
			I created a complex program using Python that modifies his photographs to represent this scary statistic - <u>that 23% of NYC will be submerged by 2100</u> - as soon enough, it will become reality.  
			Over the past few months, I, along with some freinds, have been going around the city selling this art, printed out on environmentally friendly poster paper, with the entirety of their proceeds going to 
			Environmental Advocates NY, a charity dedicated to fighting Climate Change in New York.

		<h4>
			Several people have asked if I could ship orders across the US, however, seeing as this would a) create an unnecessary carbon footprint and b) cut into the amount being donated as shipping will reduce profit margins, I 
			would rather provide the images to people to print themselves and simply request that they donate to Environmental Advoates NY or another climate charity.
