			<h4>In my second semester at Brandeis, I served as the Treasurer of the newly founded 
				Brandeis Pickleball Club.  Despite no other club doing it and it being completely unnecessary, 
				I sent out "Weekly Treasurer Emails".  These were filled with complete gibberish essentially but you can be the judge of that.  
				They can be found below.  Enjoy!
