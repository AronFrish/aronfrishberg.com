            <p class="article-content">This idea began a while ago when I coded a project I called "Not Stockfish".
                Stockfish is currently the best chess engine in the world, and plays essentially flawlessly. On the
                other hand, I'm barely breaking 900 elo on chess.com, so I thought it would be interesting to create an
                engine that ran off of my moves.</p>
            <p class="article-content">Over the course of the next week or so, I ended up doing just that. It involved
                interfacing with the chess.com API, and a bunch of work.</p>
            <p class="article-content">I've always wanted to create an open source library of my own and so a few months
                later, I had the idea of creating a Python library that made chess analytics way easier (by making both
                scraping and analysis simpler). That is the story of how chess-analytica began.</p>
            <p class="article-content">After about a week of coding, using the urllib3 and chess libraries to build on
                top of, I finalized my code. Then came the really not fun part - documentation. This took me about 5
                days to be honest, but it took me so long because I wanted to be extremely detailed, to ensure that
                others could use the code seamlessly.</p>
            <p class="article-content">After publishing my code through PyPi (which was a lot more difficult than I
                thought) and working under the umbrella of the MIT License, chess-analytica officially went into the
                public domain for any chess nerd to use freely.</p>
