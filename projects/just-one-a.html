            <p class="article-content">During the finals week of my first semester at Brandeis, I had the idea to
                start a podcast where I interviewed people from the Forbes 30 Under 30 list and asked them about 
                their experiences starting companies and just about their lives in general.

            <p class="article-content">It was one of the hardest projects I've ever undertaken, including many 
                many unanswered emails, but within two months I had interviewed 15 people from the 2023 Forbes 30 Under 30, as well as 
                Holly O'Neill, the President of Retail Banking @ BofA. I've included my favorite episode above, the one where I interviewed Zara Perumal, but the official website can be found <b><a href="https://justonea.netlify.app">here</a></b>.  The official website allows for users to view or listen on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music.</p>
