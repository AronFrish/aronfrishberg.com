<h1 style="color:#DC143C;">Hedge Fund Internship Story</h1>
<h4>One night during the summer of 2020, I had a decision.  I could play video games and relax, like usual, or do something different.
I decided to try and do something different because I would have plenty more nights like this.  I've always wanted an internship at a Hedge Fund, but
they usually require that you be a Sophomore or Junior in College, and some even require you to be graduated.  It is extremely rare for a College Freshman to get an internship at a Hedge Fund.
However slim odds never discouraged me, and so that night I decided I would try and get an internship.  I found a <a href="https://ushedgefunds.com/new-york-hedge-funds/">list of all 625 hedge funds in New york state</a>, wrote an email including my resume and past acheivements, and spent the next 6 hours and 39 minutes
 sending out emails.  By the time I was finished, it was about midnight or 1am, so I decided to go for a quick night bike and call it a night.  Most of the firms never responded, a handful politely declined, but the CEO of
 1 of the firms emailed me and said he was curious and requested an interview.  I did the interview and thought it went well.  The next night, I got an email that said that he thought an intership would be "suboptimal" for me and that he didn't believe his
 firm had the bandwith to make the experience worth my time at the moment.  I became extremely dissapointed, mostly in myself, because I had what I thought of as a 1 in a million chance, and I had blown it.
 I booted up one of the apps I had coded, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=minutemotivation.aron">Minute Motivation</a>, that lets you listen to a short motivational speech whenever.
 I played a random speech :</h4>

<h5 style="color:maroon;">It was about 2 men, who were recently laid off.  Both of them searched for a job for several weeks, but faced dissapointment and rejection.  After a month, one man stopped, he became discouraged and
 he stopped going. he stayed home, watching tv, drinking beer, and calling his other unemployed friends.  The other man kept looking everywhere.  They would tell him "You have too much education" or "You're overqualifed, you won't be here long enough".
 He went back to a place that had rejected him, and said "If you can't hire me, I know you can use my talents, abilities, and skills, I don't want to sit home all day, just give me some volunteer work, anything.".  And the interview said "Alright, it's on you now, don't expect me to give you anything", and the man agreed.
 Everyday, the man came in, he was the first one in, and the last one to leave, he was the best employee there.  Four weeks later, a manager quit, and they were looking for a replacement.  They chose the man.</h5>

<h4>After hearing that, I decided I wouldn't give up.  I remembered that in the interview, he had mentioned that he was planning on researching into a specific sector, because he thought it had potential.
So I found a stock in the sector that caught my eye, and spent the rest of the night writing a 2 page report on it.  I then wrote him an email, including the report, the story of the speech, and solutions for the problems that he proposed, and then I went to sleep.  When I woke up, I groggily checked my email, expecting another rejection.
He had responded. He said that my persistence had paid off, that I got the internship and that I would need to sign an NDA.  After signing the NDA, I worked directly under the CEO, having weekly calls, and creating in depth and complex financial and analytical reports on a wide variety of subjects.
It was one of the most incredible and educational experiences of my life.</h4>

<h3>And it all happened because of a dream, a speech and a <u>lot</u> of emails.</h3>
